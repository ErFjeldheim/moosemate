# MooseMate

## Description
MooseMate is a simple social media app where the user can create a profile and post messages in the feed, so called "moosages". Every profile is conncted to the same public forum.

## User Stories

The user stories act as foundation for the issues provided in the project board. We worked in Agile Scrum with a high-granularity backlog, focusing on many small issues instead of a few large ones.
