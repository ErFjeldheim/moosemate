# Work Practices

We have been quite disciplined with our use of time, which has allowed us to stay ahead in the project. By being consistent in our working sessions, we have accomplished more in less time and avoided last-minute stress.

Pair programming has been an important practice for us. Even though it often takes a bit longer than coding alone, we feel that both participants learn more, gain deeper insight into solutions, and produce higher-quality code. In addition, it ensures that multiple team members are familiar with the same parts of the codebase, making the group more resilient when someone is absent.

Our work habits have functioned well, but we recognize that pair programming requires patience and structure. For future projects, we might consider combining pair programming with more individual work in a deliberate way, to balance efficiency and learning.
