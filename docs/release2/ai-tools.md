# AI Tools

We have used GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code both as a sparring partner and as a code generator. It has helped us generate code blocks, structure folders, and explain approaches. The advantage of AI is that it can produce code quickly, but at the same time it may reduce ownership and understanding of the code.

We have been careful not to use AI blindly. Our practice has been to always try to understand the code that is generated. This way, we gained both efficiency and learning from the tool.

One example where AI led us somewhat astray was when we tried to implement a SessionID. None of us had prior experience with it, but AI recommended it for security reasons and even helped us program the functionality. After spending significant time on the implementation, we realized it was unnecessarily complex and decided to drop the feature in order to simplify the code. This experience taught us that AI suggestions must always be critically evaluated, and that not all recommendations should be followed even if they sound technically correct.
