# AI Tools

We have used GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code both as a sparring partner and as a code generator. It has helped us generate certain code blocks, structure folders, and explain difficult approaches that we havent been learned at univeristy. The advantage of AI is that it can produce general code quickly, and provide new knowledge. On the other hand it may reduce ownership and understanding of the code, if you don't control it. 

We have been careful not to use AI blindly. When we have used CoPilot, we have been critical to the code generated. We have proof-read it, and deleted a lot of overflow it generates. This way, we gained both efficiency and knowledge from the tool.

One example where AI led us somewhat astray was when we tried to implement a SessionID. None of us had prior experience with it, but AI recommended it for security reasons and even helped us program the functionality. After spending significant time on the implementation, we realized it was unnecessarily complex and decided to drop the feature in order to simplify the code. This experience taught us that AI suggestions must always be critically evaluated, and that not all recommendations should be followed even if they sound technically correct.
