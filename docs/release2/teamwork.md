# Reflection on Project Team Work

Throughout the project, we have maintained a clear structure for collaboration and coordination, which has contributed to both progress and learning. We decided to work together every Thursday from 9 AM to 5 PM, with regular standups throughout the day. This ensured that we always had a shared understanding of what had been done and what remained, while also creating a productive work rhythm. Outside of these sessions, we rarely needed additional follow-up, since we managed to use Thursdays effectively.

We used Notion as our main organizational tool, where we logged all issues and releases. This provided us with a shared overview of the project status and made it easy to see both completed and pending tasks. Issues were distributed based on personal interest, which allowed everyone to work on tasks they found engaging. This flexible approach worked well but also required us to balance the workload fairly. The biggest challenge in our workflow was restructuring the folder system. Since this had to be completed before starting new branches and issues, it caused some delays. However, once the new structure was in place, it made the project more robust and easier to build upon.

We have prioritized code quality and clarity over rapidly implementing many features. As a result, we currently have fewer features, but they are solid and well tested. We have experienced that pair programming takes a bit longer, but it produces better code and greater learning for everyone involved. At the same time, we learned from a specific mistake during the SessionID implementation, where we realized the importance of discussing solutions thoroughly before starting development. Overall, this project has taught us the value of structure, clear communication, and prioritizing quality in both code and collaboration.
