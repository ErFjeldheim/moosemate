# Code Quality

We have mainly performed code reviews through pull requests. We have a strict rule that no one approves their own pull request, and often we also review PRs in pairs for additional quality control. This practice has helped us catch errors early and create shared ownership of the code.

We have implemented automated tests to verify that the program behaves as expected. The test structure is organized clearly, and we have used tools like JaCoCo to monitor test coverage. In addition, we make sure to update test functions whenever we modify existing functionality.

So far, we have chosen to prioritize quality over quantity. We have relatively few features implemented, but those we do have are solid and function reliably. This gives us a strong foundation to build on and makes future expansion of the program easier and cleaner.
