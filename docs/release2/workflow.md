# Workflow

We have had sprints running from Thursday - Wednesday. We have worked together every Thursday from 9 AM to 5 PM, starting of with a daily standup. This has been important to ensure that everyone stays aligned and shares a common understanding of the progress. Outside of these sessions, we also scheduled occasional meet-ups to continue working with our partners to ensure we have met our weekly sprint goals. We have continous communication through notion and messenger. 

Notion has been our main tool for organization. Everyone in the group has used it actively, and we have logged all issues and releases there. This gave us a clear structure, allowing us to always know what still needed to be done and what was already completed.

Issues have been distributed based on interest—each person has chosen the tasks they wanted to work on. The biggest challenge in our workflow was the restructuring of the folder system. This required the new structure to be in place before we could start working on new branches and issues, which caused some delays. However, once the structure was ready, it made further development much easier.
