# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Choosing not to use artificial intelligence (AI) in the MooseMate app can be a sustainable decision, both environmentally and socially. AI technologies require significant computational power, which in turn demands large amounts of energy.  
According to a report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, training a single large language model can emit up to 284 tons of CO₂, roughly equivalent to the lifetime emissions of five cars.  

By developing MooseMate without AI, we reduce the need for powerful servers and continuous data processing, resulting in a much smaller carbon footprint.

The absence of AI also enables a simpler and more resource-efficient app that requires less data storage and bandwidth. This allows MooseMate to run smoothly on older or more affordable devices, extending the lifespan of existing technology, which aligns with the principles of a circular economy.

# Low Energy Consumption

At present, no database runs continuously (24/7). This reduces server costs, energy consumption, and overall carbon footprint.

# Multi-Modularity

A multi-modular architecture, using separate modules for UI, Core, Persistence, and REST, provides a sustainable and efficient implementation.

- Running individual modules consumes less energy than running the entire system each time.  
- Team members can work on separate modules without affecting the entire project, reducing development time and resource waste.  
- Limited technical depth keeps refactoring efforts contained within specific modules, improving maintainability and reducing long-term costs.

# Testing

Extensive test coverage helps prevent costly production hotfixes and emergency deployments. This saves developer time and reduces the number of rollbacks and redeployments, contributing to a more stable and sustainable development cycle.
