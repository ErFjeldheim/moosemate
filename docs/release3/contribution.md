## Contribution

Erik: Erik has primarily been responsible for developing the tests. He has worked continously to meet the test coverage requirements, and implemented test configurations such as JaCoCo, testFX, checkstyle and spotbugs. The other team members have rotated in pairs with him. We have experimented running MooseMate on an online server in which Erik runs at home, to prepare for a potential launch in the future. In release 3, Erik made the diagrams located in the docs folder.

Syver: Syver has been responsible for keeping track on the git structure, to make sure there are noe loose ends, or unclear issues, commits etc. He has also been the main contributor to our applications frontend, working in Scenebuilder, with CSS and creating controller classes. This is due to the fact that he has experience in design from his engagement in our student association's newsletter comitee.

Holger: Holger has contributed to the making of services files and rest-API setup. On his spare-time, Holger has also made additions to the UI. In essence Holger has been working full stack, but primarily on the backend. For instance, he was responsible for the the forum feed functionality, and making sure the UI communicates with the rest-api backend. 

Edvard: Edvard contributed on the UI side of the application. With Syver, Edvard has programmed in pairs in making the fronted in scenebuilder, additionally using CSS to make the UI look approachable. In release 2 and 3, Edvard had the main responsibility for documentation.

Katharina: Katharina has worked primarily on the backend side of the app. Such as: making services files, rest-api setup and test-configuration. When refacturing the folder structure (adding multi-module functionaly) her contribution was key. Holger and Katharina worked closely, often pair programming, assuring that the server side of MooseMate works properly.
