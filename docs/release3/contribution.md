## Contribution

Erik: Erik has been the main responsible for developing the tests. He has worked continously to meet the test coverage requirements, and implemented test requirements such as JaCoCo. The other team members have rotated in pairs with him. Erik is also running a IT business next to his studies, in which he is consulting small local companies. He has used this knowledge to his advantage, and for instance helped with running MooseMate on his local server, to make it online.

Syver: Syver has had the main responsibility for keeping track on the git structure, to make sure there are noe loose ends, or unclear issues, commits etc. He has also taken a main responsibility for frontend, working in Scenebuilder, with CSS and creating controller classes. As he has experience in design from his engagement in our student association's new comitee.

Holger: Holger has contributing to the making of services files and rest-API setup. On his spare-time, Holger has also made positive additions to the UI. In essence Holger has been working full stack, but primarily on the backend.

Edvard: Edvard has worked on the documentation part of the project. Aditionally, he has contributed on the UI side of the application. Syver and Edvard has programmed in pairs in making the UI in scenebuilder, using CSS, making the frontend look good. He assisted in constructing services files in the begging of the project.

Katharina: Katharina has worked primarily on the backend side of the app. She has contributed in the making of services files, rest-api setup and test-configuration. And when refacturing the folder structure - adding multi-modularity - she was vital. Holger and Katharina has worked closely, often pair programming - assuring that the server side of MooseMate is working properly.
