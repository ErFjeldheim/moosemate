# AI Tools

We have used GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code similar to the way we did in the previous releases. It has been especially helpful in the process of implementing the REST API, as we had to refactor many tests to work correctly with the new structure. For instance were there a lot of boolean values in the LoginServerTest that had to be changed to User. AI helped us do this more efficiently, as the tests were already created but neede minimal modification, that still required a lot of time.

We have also used Copilot as a sparring partner to help with JavaFX design, as it is hard to make adaptable and smooth. This has resultet in a more user friendly web application.
