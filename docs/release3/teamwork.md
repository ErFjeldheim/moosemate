reflekter om hvordan har planlagt og koordinert teamet ditt prosjektarbeidet underveis i prosjektet so langt, og hva lærte dere av denne erfaringen? (200–300 ord)


## Teamwork

When release 3 was published the group met up to get an overview of the requirements and organize the project. We created a new view in the Git project board, and divided the release's requirements into smaller issues. This made it easy to monitor progress and time, while ensuring that all requirements were met. 

Initally, our plan was to migrate the frontend to React. We spent a day refactoring before realizing that implementing new features in React, would also require maintaining the JavaFX. This resulted in a decision to stick to JavaFX, to focus on one frontend only.

After this decision, we divided into two teams: one frontend team with three members, and one backend team with two members. This improved efficienct, especially in backend. We also held a design workshop to brainstorm the layout of the forum feed, which gave us valuable insights. As issues were completed, members rotated between documentation and fullstack work, to balance the workload.

Through this process, we learned the importance of well-planned issues for efficiency, and staying flexible to solve smaller problems when they arose. The GitHub project board made it easy for everyone to track progress and coordinate sessions. Overall, the workflow strengtened our collaboration skills, meet the requirements on time.
