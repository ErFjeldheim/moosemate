# Group Reflection 1

## Overview

We quickly learnt that we need to communicate better about delegation. People got eager in the beginning, which resultet in multiple similar issues being created, which caused a messy overview. We quickly realized that we needed to communicate clearer, and completed a session in which we together came up with the issues, and closed the overflowing ones. 

## Positive experiences

- Worked efficiently as a team

- On day 2 we reviewed and refined all issues, improving their wording. On day 1 we got a bit carried away and created too many issues without a clear system.

- Tasks were well distributed and organized by using the github project board

- Pair programming worked very well.

- Booking a dedicated group room greatly helped us stay focused and quickly regain concentration if we drifted off.

## Potential improvements

- Plan the entire release more thoroughly

- Define clear issues from the start.

- Establish very clear Git guidelines.

- Keep the issue board and milestone updated continuously

- Do *not* close an issue until every checkbox in its description is ticked.

- Double-check (even triple-check) all work to avoid duplicate effort and confusion.

- Focus more on setting classes and IDs in SceneBuilder before implementing functions in the .java files. This makes merging functionality and visuals easier.
