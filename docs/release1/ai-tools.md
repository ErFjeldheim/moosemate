# AI Tools Documentation

In this JavaFX-project we have used the following AI tools, assisted by Copilot Pro in VSCode:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- ChatGPT 5

The AI tools help us with:

- **Simplicity**: breaking down complex problems into clear, step-by-step solutions.

- **Suggestions**: more efficient implemetations of already existing code and generating simple code snippets.

- **Debugging**: locating issues, reducing time spent on trial and error.

- **Learning**: Explaining unfamiliar aspects of Java of JavaFX in the specific contexts of the project
